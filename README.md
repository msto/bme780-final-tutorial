# BME 780 Tutorial

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook and supporting code for my final
tutorial in BME 780 on dimensionality reduction.

## Primary tutorial files
* dimensionality reduction tutorial.ipynb  
    Jupyter notebook containing the tutorial and runnable code.
* dimensionality reduction tutorial.html  
    Static HTML rendering of the notebook (viewable without a Jupyter server).
## Supporting code and data
* data/  
    Expression matrix and cell labels from the Tran et al. dataset.
* dimensionality reduction tutorial appendix.ipynb  
    Jupyter notebook containing the code used to generate the figures in the
    Background and Algorithms section. This code wasn't directly relevant and
    I thought it would clutter the tutorial.
* figs/  
    Supplemental figures generated from the appendix; used in the Background
    and Algorithms sections.
